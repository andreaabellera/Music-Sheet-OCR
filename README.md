This is a personal project I attempted after my second year in school. 
However, I stopped to consider taking this project in a different direction, such as using OpenCV instead of Numpy. I will return to the project once I finish AI and Graphics studies, which is vital for forming the backend that this program requires. Replacing my haphazard attempt at Tkinter with a better GUI is definitely in my bucket list.
